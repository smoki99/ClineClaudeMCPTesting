## Purpose
This document explains why this project exists, the problems it solves, and how it should work from a user perspective.

## Problem Statement
- Creating long-form YouTube content requires significant time investment
- Manual video editing for hour-long videos is labor-intensive
- Maintaining consistent quality across long videos is challenging
- Tracking music usage for YouTube attribution is error-prone
- Development and testing of long videos needs efficient workflows

## User Experience Goals
- Automate video creation process completely
- Ensure professional-quality output
- Maintain accurate music attribution
- Support both development and production needs
- Enable cloud-based operation

## User Workflows
### Development Flow
1. Place input files in clips/ and music/ directories
2. Set desired duration (1 hour or test duration)
3. Run generator
4. Review logs and output files
5. Verify video quality and transitions

### Production Flow
1. Configure cloud environment
2. Upload input files
3. Trigger video generation
4. Download completed video and tracklist
5. Upload to YouTube with generated attribution

## Key Features
- Automated 1-hour video generation
- Random music track selection without repetition
- Random clip selection with no consecutive repeats
- Smooth audio and video transitions, scaling videos to 1920x1080 if needed
- Track name overlay with fade effects
- Detailed logging for verification
- Use libx264 encoder for faster rendering and better compatibility
- Configurable duration for testing
- Tracklist generation for YouTube attribution

## User Personas
### Content Creator

- System generates complete 1-hour video without errors
- Content creator uploads video with correct attribution
- System operates reliably in cloud environment
- All transitions appear smooth and professional

## Pain Points Addressed
- Eliminates manual video editing
- Automates music track selection
- Ensures proper attribution tracking
- Reduces testing time with configurable duration
- Provides comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Integration Points
### Input Integration

- Music directory for MP3 files

### System Integration
- ffmpeg for video processing
- Python runtime environment
- Cloud deployment platform

### Output Integration
- Video file for YouTube upload
- Tracklist for video description
- Logs for system monitoring

## Notes
- This document focuses on the user perspective and product value
- Changes here may impact implementation decisions in systemPatterns.md
- User feedback should be reflected in this document
