## Purpose
This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues.

## Project Status
### Overall Status
- Phase: Initialization
- Progress: Planning Phase
- Next Milestone: Development Environment Setup

### Current Sprint Goals
1. Project structure setup
2. Documentation framework
3. Development environment
4. Initial audio processing

## Working Features
### Documentation
- ✓ Memory Bank structure
- ✓ Project requirements
- ✓ System architecture
- ✓ Technical specifications

### Infrastructure
- Initial project structure (0%)
- Development environment (0%)
- Test framework (0%)

## In Progress
### Core System
- Project scaffolding (10%)
  - Directory structure defined
  - Pending actual creation
  
- Development setup (5%)
  - Tools identified
  - Pending installation scripts

### Documentation
- System design (80%)
  - Architecture defined
  - Patterns selected
  - Pending final review

## Pending Features
### High Priority
1. Audio Processing System
   - File handling
   - Track sequencing
   - Crossfading

2. Video Processing System
   - Clip management
   - Transitions
   - Text overlay

### Medium Priority
1. Testing Framework

   - Deployment scripts
   - Monitoring setup

## Known Issues
### Critical
- None at this stage (project initialization)

### Non-Critical

- Test data requirements undefined
- Performance metrics not yet established

## Technical Debt
### Current
- None (new project)

### Anticipated
1. Initial rapid development
   - Impact: Code organization
   - Plan: Regular refactoring

2. Testing coverage
   - Impact: Quality assurance
   - Plan: TDD approach

## Testing Status
### Framework Status
- Unit tests: Not started
- Integration tests: Not started
- Performance tests: Not started

### Coverage Goals
- Core logic: 0% (Target: 90%+)
- File handlers: 0% (Target: 85%+)
- Integration: 0% (Target: 80%+)
