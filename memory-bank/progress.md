Last Updated: 2025-03-07

## Purpose
This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues.

## Project Status
### Overall Status
- Phase: Initialization
- Progress: Planning Phase
- Next Milestone: Development Environment Setup

### Current Sprint Goals
1. Project structure setup
2. Documentation framework
3. Development environment
4. Initial audio processing

## Working Features
### Documentation
- ✓ Memory Bank structure
- ✓ Project requirements
- ✓ System architecture
- ✓ Technical specifications

### Infrastructure
- Initial project structure (100%)
- Development environment (95%)
- Test framework (0%)

## In Progress
### Core System
- Project scaffolding (50%)
  - Directory structure created
  - Pending component implementation
  
- Development setup (95%)
  - Conda environment created
  - Dependencies installed
  - Pending validation

### Documentation
- System design (95%)
  - Architecture defined
  - Patterns selected
  - Implementation details documented
  - Pending final review

## Pending Features
### High Priority
1. Audio Processing System
   - File handling
   - Track sequencing
   - Crossfading

2. Video Processing System
   - Clip management
   - Transitions
   - Text overlay

### Medium Priority
1. Testing Framework
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Performance tests

### Low Priority
1. Cloud Deployment
   - Service selection
   - Deployment scripts
   - Monitoring setup

## Known Issues
### Critical
- None at this stage (project initialization)

### Non-Critical
- Test data requirements undefined
- Performance metrics not yet established
- Need to validate FFmpeg integration
- Need to validate environment setup

## Technical Debt
### Current
- None (new project)

### Anticipated
1. Initial rapid development
   - Impact: Code organization
   - Plan: Regular refactoring

2. Testing coverage
   - Impact: Quality assurance
   - Plan: TDD approach

## Testing Status
### Framework Status
- Unit tests: Not started
- Integration tests: Not started
- Performance tests: Not started

### Coverage Goals
- Core logic: 0% (Target: 90%+)
- File handlers: 0% (Target: 85%+)
- Integration: 0% (Target: 80%+)

### Test Results
- Pending execution of test suite
- Need to analyze FFmpeg command tests
- Need to analyze performance tests
- Need to analyze overlay tests

## Notes
- Development environment setup complete
