## Purpose
This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions/considerations.

## Current Focus
### Project Initialization
- Setting up initial project structure
- Establishing documentation framework
- Defining core requirements
- Planning development approach

### Development Priorities
1. Audio processing system
   - Music file handling
   - Track sequencing
   - Crossfade implementation
2. Video processing system
   - Clip management
   - Transition effects
   - Text overlay

## Recent Changes
### Last Session
- Created Memory Bank structure
- Documented project requirements
- Defined system architecture
- Established technical specifications

### Pending Changes
- Project scaffolding
- Development environment setup
- Test framework implementation
- Initial component development

## Active Decisions
### Architecture Decisions
- Component separation strategy
  - Pros: Better testing, maintainability
  - Cons: Initial development overhead
- File-based state management
  - Pros: Simple, reliable, cloud-ready
  - Cons: Storage overhead, cleanup needed

### Technical Decisions
- ffmpeg integration approach
  - Considering: Direct CLI vs Python bindings
  - Impact: Performance vs Development speed
- Testing strategy
  - Considering: Test sizes and mock scope
  - Impact: Development velocity vs Coverage

## Current Challenges
### Technical Challenges
#### FFmpeg Integration
- Process Management:
  - Challenge: Zombie processes and memory leaks
  - Solution: Implemented process group handling with signal management
  - Status: Pattern documented, pending implementation

- Video Operations:
  - Challenge: Frame misalignment during concatenation
  - Solution: Using concat demuxer with stream copying
  - Status: Researched from existing projects

- Error Handling:
  - Challenge: Complex ffmpeg output parsing
  - Solution: Structured error classification system
  - Status: Pattern documented with implementation

- Resource Management:
  - Challenge: Memory spikes during long operations
  - Solution: Chunked processing with progress monitoring
  - Status: Implementation pattern defined

### Development Challenges
#### Testing Strategy
- Test data management:
  - Need sample clips and music files
  - Various durations and formats
  - Edge case scenarios

#### Performance Testing
- Memory profiling during long operations
- CPU utilization patterns
- Disk I/O optimization
- Hardware acceleration testing

#### Implementation Approach
- Starting with process management
- Then error handling system
- Followed by resource management
- Finally performance optimization

## Next Steps
### Immediate Tasks
1. Set up development environment
   - Python virtual environment
   - Dependencies installation
   - ffmpeg configuration
   
2. Implement core audio processing
   - File reading
   - Track sequencing
   - Basic concatenation

3. Create test framework
   - Unit test structure
   - Integration test plan
   - Test data preparation

### Upcoming Work
1. Video processing implementation
2. Text overlay system
3. Integration testing
4. Performance optimization
5. Cloud deployment preparation

## Open Questions
### Technical Questions
