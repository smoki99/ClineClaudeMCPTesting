## Problem
The file path `D:\dev\ClineClaudeMCPTesting\test_files\clips/girls1.mp4` is incorrect and should be `D:\dev\ClineClaudeMCPTesting\clips\girls1.mp4`. The project needs to be cross-platform compatible (Windows and Linux), so path separator differences (`\` and `/`) need to be handled.

## Plan
1.  **Identify where the incorrect file path is being used.** Use the `search_files` tool to search for the specific file path `D:\dev\ClineClaudeMCPTesting\test_files\clips/girls1.mp4` within the project.
2.  **Analyze the context of where the incorrect file path is being used.** Use the `read_file` tool to examine the contents of the files where the incorrect path is present to understand how the path is being used.
3.  **Implement a helper function (if necessary) to handle path separator differences.** If the file path is being constructed dynamically, create a helper function that can convert between Windows and Linux path separators. This function will ensure that the correct path separator is used based on the operating system.
4.  **Correct the file path.** Use the `replace_in_file` tool to replace the incorrect path with the correct path `D:\dev\ClineClaudeMCPTesting\clips\girls1.mp4`. If a helper function is implemented, use it to ensure the correct path separator is used.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
The implementation will consider the need for cross-platform compatibility (Windows and Linux) and the potential need to handle different path separators (`\` and `/`).
