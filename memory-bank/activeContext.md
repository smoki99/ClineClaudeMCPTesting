## Audio Management Implementation

### Current Status
- Basic AudioManager class implemented
- Successfully tested audio concatenation with random files
- Working path normalization and file handling
- Basic test coverage in place

### Next Implementation Phase: Project Integration

1. **Songlist Management Enhancement**
   ```python
   {
       "songs": [
           {
               "path": "music/song1.mp3",
               "duration": 240,
               "title": "Song Title",
               "artist": "Artist Name"
           }
       ],
       "total_duration": 0
   }
   ```

2. **Implementation Steps**
   a) Songlist Creation:
      - Scan music directory recursively
      - Calculate accurate durations using FFmpeg
      - Extract metadata (title, artist) from files
      - Generate and validate songlist JSON

   b) AudioManager Integration:
      - Replace direct FFmpeg calls with AudioManager methods
      - Implement proper error handling
      - Add validation for audio formats
      - Create consistent directory structure

   c) Testing Strategy:
      - Unit tests for new functionality
      - Integration tests for full workflow
      - Performance testing for large playlists
      - Error handling verification

3. **Required Changes**
   - Add metadata extraction to AudioManager
   - Implement duration calculation methods
   - Create songlist validation
   - Add progress tracking for long operations

4. **Directory Structure**
```
project/
├── music/               # Source music files
├── test_files/         # Generated test files
│   └── test_audio/    # Output directory for tests
├── src/
│   ├── audio/         # Audio processing modules
│   └── utils/         # Utility functions
└── tests/             # Test files
```

5. **Success Criteria**
   - Accurate song duration calculation
   - Correct metadata extraction
   - Valid songlist JSON generation
   - Successful audio concatenation
   - Proper error handling
   - Comprehensive test coverage

### Current Tasks
1. Modify AudioManager to handle metadata
2. Implement songlist creation from directory
3. Add validation for audio files
4. Create integration tests
5. Document all new functionality

### Testing Strategy
1. Create test cases for:
   - Songlist generation
   - Metadata extraction
   - Audio validation
   - Error conditions
   - Full workflow integration

2. Test with various scenarios:
   - Different audio formats
   - Invalid files
   - Large playlists
   - Missing metadata
   - Corrupt files

3. Performance considerations:
   - Memory usage for large playlists
   - Processing time optimization
   - Progress reporting for long operations

### Future Enhancements
1. Support for additional audio formats
2. Advanced metadata handling
3. Playlist organization features
4. Audio quality control
5. Performance optimizations

Ready to proceed with implementation. Next step is to create the enhanced version of the script using AudioManager class.
